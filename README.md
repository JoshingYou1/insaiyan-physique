## Summary:

This workout application allows the user to choose exercises based on specific muscle categories. The user has the ability to select each individual muscle category which in turn will take the user to a page containing a list of exercises pertaining to whichever muscle category was selected. Once the user finds an exercise they want to learn more about, they simply click on the corresponding link which will take them to another page that provides a plethora of information regarding that exercise. The information page includes a description of the exercise, images showing the full movement of the exercise, what equipment(if any) is required to complete the exercise, the specific muscles being targeted by the exercise along with diagrams highlighting those muscles, additional comments, and instructional vidoes on how to properly perform the exercise.
